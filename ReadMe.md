This is a sample (incomplete) app to show two basic approaches to writing software.  One branch shows the classic route of creating interfaces and Dependency Injection/IOC Container for most all resources.  The other branch shows how the use of pure functions can minimize IOC container usage, while creating declarative pipelines for workflows that still maintains the same SOLID principles.
